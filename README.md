
# 2 Layers MLP Classifcator for Pima Indians Diabetes Database

It was achieved:
99% accuracy for train dataset
62.9% accuracy for test dataset

Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Inspiration
Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

Dataset Content
The Pima Indians diabetes dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given the medical details.

It is a binary classification problem (2 classes). The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. The missing values ​​are believed to be encoded with zero values.

The names of the variables are as follows:

Number of pregnancies.
2-hour plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test.
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
2-hour serum insulin (mu U / ml).
Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m) ^ 2).
Role of the pedigree of diabetes.
Age.
Class variable (0 or 1). The benchmark performance for predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 65%. The best results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 77%.
